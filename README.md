# Next.js Data Fetching

This project is part of my Next.js course journey on Coursera, focusing on data fetching techniques in Next.js applications.

## Overview

Next.js provides powerful data fetching methods that allow developers to build fast and scalable applications. In this project, I will demonstrate various data fetching strategies using Next.js, including:

- Static Generation (SSG)
- Server-side Rendering (SSR)
- Client-side Rendering (CSR)

## Features

- **Static Generation**: Pre-render pages at build time using `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`.
- **Server-side Rendering**: Fetch data on each request using `getServerSideProps`.
- **Client-side Rendering**: Use React hooks to fetch data on the client side.
